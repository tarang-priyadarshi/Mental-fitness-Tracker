# Mental-fitness-Tracker
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. 
So, the need to find out the mental fitness state based on 11 features of mental health.
In this project we have to find the mental fitness rate and assess and predict an individual's mental well-being, resilience, and cognitive functioning.
The scope would involve analyzing various factors that could contribute to an individual's mental well-being. This might include personal characteristics ,lifestyle factors social support systems, and environmental influences. 

The end users of this project depends on its specific applications and context. 
1. Individuals: The primary end users would be individuals themselves. People could use mental fitness prediction tools or services to gain insights into their mental well-being, identify potential areas for improvement
2. Mental Health Professionals: Mental health professionals could use the predictions as supplementary information to aid in their assessments and treatment planning. 
We have to collect data and form it into a database so we have different factors to predict the mental fitness rate.
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for mental fitness prediction. Mainly we will use linear regression algorithm then train the selected models using the preprocessed data, and evaluate their performance through cross-validation.
